# PACMAN @ PIF analysis
A set of GNU OCTAVE and R scripts and functions to work with PACMAN data and prepare it for publication.
It assumes that you have access to the raw datafiles or the cleaned and patched datafiles from a PACMAN deployment.
The plots are specific to the publication that these were generated for.
